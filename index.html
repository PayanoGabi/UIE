        <li> <img src="images/ben-callahan.jpg" alt="Ben Callahan Picture">Ben Callahan <a href="https://uxim14.uie.com/featured-talks#ben-callahan">Dissecting Design</a><p>Imagine showing clients your work in Week 1, before any details are refined or big decisions made. How would they respond? Ben Callahan knows, and he’ll tell you how his team transitioned away from a linear design process with a big reveal–ta-da!</p></li>
        <li><img src="images/cyd-harrell.jpg" alt="Cyd Harrel Picture">Cyd Harrell <a href="https://uxim14.uie.com/featured-talks#cyd-harrell"> Doing “Pocket Research” to Learn About Your Users’ Lives</a><p>Given the ubiquity of mobile–even among hard-to-reach populations–UX designers are poised to make data-driven design a standard practice. And gathering that data is easier than ever if you listen to Cyd Harrell, whose quick tips for doing mobile research are practical for any team.</p></li>
        <li><img src="images/brad-frost.jpg" alt="Brad Frost Picture">Brad Frost <a href="https://uxim14.uie.com/featured-talks#brad-frost">Building Design Systems from Atomic Elements</a><p>Are words like “speed” and “flexibility” part of your work? If so, don’t miss Brad Frost’s introduction to Atomic Design, a methodology he uses to break down page-based layouts into smaller components. He’ll talk about establishing your own system to create smart, scalable designs.</p></li>

Now we have touch screens, cameras, voice control, and sensors–but how do we design for the explosion of these dynamic inputs? Jason Grigsby has some ideas you’ll want to hear.</p></li>
        <li><img src="images/karen-mcgrane.jpg" alt="Karen McGrane Picture">Karen McGrane <a href="https://uxim14.uie.com/featured-talks#karen-mcgrane"> Defining Your Mobile Content Strategy</a><p>Today, 33 percent of people in America only use a mobile device to browse online. So why are companies still approaching mobile content from a desktop perspective? Find out from Karen McGrane, who’ll discuss how to define a mobile content strategy that’ll work for your organization and your users, too.</p></li>

With Nate Schutta’s guidance, you’ll help your team answer this question by asking the “right” business questions, considering today’s UX trends, and keeping up with mobile’s constant evolution.</p></li>
